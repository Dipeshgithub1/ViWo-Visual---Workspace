
VI-WO (Visual Workspace) - 
Purpose of Making ViWo was to help teams with remote collaboration and empower teams to 
work more efficiently, creatively, and cohesively in a digital environment. And in this day and 
age, more and more teams are remote or distributed and need some way to collaborate in real 
time, no matter their location or timezone.  
Not just a whiteboarding platform, It’s an online workspace for innovation.
